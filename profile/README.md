## Welcome to the Cedar Creek Tech Team!

Here we can manage and track items that need to be addressed by the team.

Contact Jeremy Fox if you need access to participate.

## Note that this is just me playing around with GitHub as a potential task management tool. I have invited a few people to participate as a trial.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
